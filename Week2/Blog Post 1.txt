First of all, I have to admit that I did the exact same mistake Lissa mentioned of jumping right into the design process, without taking into account the Five Considerations. I designed a pretty generic wireframe for a recipe website based on how I imagine it should look like. Looking back, these 5 considerations would've helped me a lot in terms of streamlining the website for my (potential) target audience. For instance, sketching the wireframe and a small sitemap would’ve helped me design the webpage to facilitate navigation around the website. As for feedback, I did something of the sort, where I showed my initial wireframe on MS PowerPoint to some friends who gave me feedback on how to change it, in terms of layout and final color scheme (visible on my recipe webpage).  Of course, PowerPoint might not be the best wireframing software out there; so, going forward, I will probably switch my tool of choice into something a bit more sophisticated.
