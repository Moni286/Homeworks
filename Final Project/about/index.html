			Hello and welcome to my personal blog. A bit about me first: My name is Mounir Elgharabawy and I am a Computer Engineering major enrolled in New York University Abu Dhabi, graduating in 2018. This year, I am studying abroad in New York, at the Tandon School of Engineering which is quite a lot of fun. I love exploring new places and cities I've never been to. Up until now, I've been to around 9 different countries, and I hope to explore quite a bit more in the near future.</p>
		<p>
			During my studies as a Computer Engineer, I picked up various interests and got to learn about a lot of new stuff, most of which I'll be sharing on this blog. As of now, I am focusing on computer security and hacking. However, I'll also be posting about other things I'm interested in, such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and Gaming. From time to time, I might post some interesting tutorial videos I found on these fields.
